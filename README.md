# Ayudante: the bot that will take over the world.
Ayudante is built on top of the Courvix Network's API. Originally contracted to assist with translation with our international chat, it's become more than that. We intend to use more API endpoints, showing what the API is capable of.

# What is the Courvix Network?
The Courvix Network is a beautiful network of free services, including a VPN, an email service and an API. You can find our [site here](https://courvix.com) and our [Discord here](https://discord.gg/EuxrbcvJAS)
# Can I copy code?
Yes, you can copy code without retribution. I wouldn't have gotten to where I am without learning from open source code. I just hope that you decide to use this code to assist you further with building your dreams; and not copying it outright.

# What if there are issues?
Report in the [Courvix Network's Discord](https://discord.gg/EuxrbcvJAS) so we can help you out
